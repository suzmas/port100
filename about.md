Hi, my name is Suzan.


I'm passionate about building things to solve problems.


I spend most of my free time teaching myself to write software by reading whatever I can get my hands on and creating things from it.


The rest of my time goes to DIY projects building and fixing things in my house with (my favorite) *power tools*.
